// Precipitation, rain or snow: streaks of falling drops in four layers, nearer ones larger, faster
// and more opaque, in one pass over the scene, after the composite rainfall of ToyShop (Tatarchuk
// 2006). The drops are laid out on the sphere of view directions, around the direction they fall
// toward: drops falling along parallel lines appear on great circles through it, so in its Mercator
// coordinates (the angle around it, and log(tan(theta / 2)) of the angle theta from it) the drops
// of a layer, at one distance, are a regular grid scrolling at a constant rate: their size and
// speed on the sphere both go with sin(theta). The streaks fall down the screen at the horizon and
// radiate from below the camera when it looks down. The drops are hidden behind what is nearer than
// their layer, and the rain veils the distance in an overcast haze, whose light the drops refract,
// and in shafts of heavier rain hanging below the cloud base. The wind comes in gusts. The snow,
// from 0 to 1, turns the rain to snow in one population: the drops slow down from 9 m/s to 1 m/s,
// which shortens their streak, and grow from thin sharp lines into soft round flakes that flutter,
// the nearest layer out of focus as in Andrew Baldwin's "Just snow", in a thicker, whiter haze.
// Where it rains comes from the map: the shafts and the share of each ray in the rain from the
// shafts' pass, the drops from the map's intensity at the camera, read on the CPU. The haze's length
// below the cloud base is this pass's, from each pixel's depth, sharp at the ridges. Seen from
// above, where Clouds draws the clouds, they hide the rain under them: no shafts nor haze.
