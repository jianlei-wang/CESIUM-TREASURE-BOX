// Lightning, cloud-to-ground strikes: a branching channel from the cloud base to the ground, with 2 to 4
// return strokes tens of milliseconds apart, down one channel, and a flash that follows their flicker, as
// in the descriptions of the lightning flash (Rakov and Uman, "Lightning: Physics and Effects", 2003). The
// channel is drawn over the picture in screen space as a hot core in a halo, at least a pixel and a half
// wide: a channel is centimeters wide, and a thousand meters away it would not show at its true width. It
// is a line from the cloud to the ground that wanders to either side, by value noise of the position along
// it in four octaves, pinned at both ends, with branches that leave it downward at an angle and wander the
// same way, fading toward their ends. The distance to it is the pixel's across the line, less the wander,
// over the slope of the wander, so that the width stays the same where it zigzags: a function of the
// position along the line, a handful of noise lookups for each channel, not a polyline for each pixel.
// The channel is hidden behind nearer terrain. The flash lights each pixel in proportion to its own color,
// less with its distance to the strike, and the sky toward the cloud above it. Seen from above the cloud
// base, the channel is hidden in the cloud, and the flash lights the cloud over the strike from inside, as
// a glow. Needs EyeFromDepth and Hash.
